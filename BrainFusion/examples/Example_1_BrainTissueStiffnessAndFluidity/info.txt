# Dataset: AFM stiffness and fluidity measurements of Xenopus laevis embryonic brain tissue

In this example, you can explore the BrainFusion package before using your own data in the following steps.
 1. Given brightfield images of exposed brains together with the already annotated brain tissue boundary you calculate an average brain shape.
 2. You find transformations that map each individual brain boundary to the average brain shape and apply those to the AFM data defined on the original shapes.
 3. You cluster the transformed data using a Gaussian Mixture model and create an averaged AFM stiffness and fluidity map of the embryonic brain.
 4. With both averaged maps you then calculate the spatial correlation between stiffness and fluidity measurements.

# This folder contains several subfolders, each representing an experiment where a single brain is mapped.
# Each subfolder contains a 'region analysis' folder with a data.csv file, containing all measurement parameters.
# The x/y coordinates are already transformed to the coordinate system of the x56 overview brightfield images in the 'Pics/calibration' folder.
# Additionally, the region of interest (e.g. the embryos forebrain) is already annotated and the coordinates stored in a txt file.
# This folder structure of AFM data is similar to the output of the batchforce.mat script used to analyse AFM data of brain tissue stiffness maps
# For your own data, you need to write a new import function to use the script
